# CS-455-Introduction-to-Programming-Systems-Design
This course covers programming in Java and C++. Topics include review of basic programming concepts such as control structures, functions, and arrays; coverage of more advanced programming topics such as classes, recursion, inheritance, and linked lists; use of a container class library to program with tools such as a map class and a sort function; and an introduction to algorithm analysis. There will also be an emphasis on good development techniques such as good code style and documentation, unit testing and use of debugging tools. A second goal of the course is to introduce the Unix programming environment, including tools such as the shell, simple shell scripts, and makefiles.
