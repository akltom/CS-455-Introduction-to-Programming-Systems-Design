CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]


In the RandomWalkComponent class, I use the code from the textbook 
section 2.9.2 (Drawing a component)
----------------------------------------------
KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:


I took this class last semester, so my codes and formatwould be very
close to what I submitted last semester. I have already took the 
professor that some of my work would be similar to the past.

ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:


1. The drunkard has many dead ends, it is because after a point first 
gets generated from the orginal, the second point goes exactly the 
opposite direction. Then, the other points that get generated later
go elsewhere direction and never return to the first point position. 
Therefore, many paths taken by the drunkard have "dead end".

2. When the program gets minimized or maximinzed, the graphics output 
has changed and re-generated to a different and new one. It is because 
when we iconify the program, the paintComponent gets called. Hence, 
the window will get redrawn and generate a new graphics output.

3. One of the possible way is to create a empty text file. Then, when 
the first graphics output is generated, we copy the output into this 
file. So whenever we need to print or see the graphics output, we can
just call this file again. By doing this, the original graphics get 
stored and we can avoid to lose that part of information.
