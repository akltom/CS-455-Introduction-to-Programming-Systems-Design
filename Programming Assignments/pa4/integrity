The USC Student Conduct Code prohibits plagiarism. All USC students
are responsible for reading and following the Student Conduct Code,
which, as well as being available through the link just given, appears
in the sections on University Governance (sections 10.00-16.00) in the
current version of SCampus.

In this course we encourage students to study together. This includes
discussing general strategies to be used on individual
assignments. However, all work submitted for the class is to be done
individually, unless an assignment specifies otherwise. Also, all
exams are closed book, closed note.

Some examples of what is not allowed by the conduct code: copying all
or part of someone else's work and submitting it as your own, giving
another student in the class a copy of your assignment solution,
consulting with another student during an exam. If you have questions
about what is allowed, please discuss it with the instructor.

Because of past problems with plagiarism in this and other computer
science courses, we may be running all submitted programming
assignments through sophisticated plagiarism-detection software.

Violations of the Student Conduct Code will be filed with the Office
of Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards (SJACS), and
appropriate sanctions will be given.
