CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:

GenText class:
It contains the main method. This class is responsible for checking the if there 
are errors for command-line arguments. It also opens the input file, generate 
the last prefix, initialize the hash map by generating all the possible prefixs 
with their corressponding successors. Finally, it takes a array list that contains
all the random successors generated by Random TextGenerator class, and print them 
out in an output text file.

Prefix class:
Define methods about the Prefix class, so that we can use them either in GenText 
or Random TextGenerator class. I also rewrote the Hashcode and equal methods.

Random TextGenerator class:
This contains most of the program logic and data structures, and have a few methods. 
There are two methods, one is to generate a random Prefix (initially, and when the 
line has more than 80 characters). Another method, generateRandomText, is to generate 
an array list that contains all the successors. This method will consistingly 
generates prefixes and corresponding successors until reaching to numWords times.

CommandErrorException class:
This class is created to take care of all the command error exception in the 
methods, and be able to throw back the exception to the main.

DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CLASS DESIGN AND ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES USED:

I took this class last semester so some of my codes might be similar with 
the previous one.
